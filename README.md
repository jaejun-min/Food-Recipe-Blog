Some people are worried about gaining weight and do not want to eat fast food but do not have time to cook healthy food.  I would like to make a website that will provide food recipes that can be searched and filtered by type, time to cook, calories, and ingredients.  I will build my website by integrating food and recipe APIs.  Users of my website will be able to search for recipes that they want to eat and have the time and ingredients to make.  Users can also upload their own recipes and create and edit favorite lists of recipes they liked or want to make in the future.  I will use some ember addons such as ember-moment and ember-burger-menu to style my website look efficiently.
