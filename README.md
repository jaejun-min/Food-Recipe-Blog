# Food Recipe Blog

**Project Description**

Some people are worried about gaining weight and do not want to eat fast food but do not have time to cook healthy food. Website that will provide food recipes that can be searched and filtered by type, time to cook, calories, and ingredients. Build website by integrating food and recipe APIs. Users will be able to search for recipes that they want to eat and have the time and ingredients to make. Users can also upload their own recipes and create and edit favorite lists of recipes they liked or want to make in the future. Use some ember addons such as ember-moment and ember-burger-menu to style my website look efficiently.
