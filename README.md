Some people are so obsessive about getting a weight and against instant food from outside. I would like to make website that will provide food information recipe so they can cook to reduce their stress from eating outside food. I will like to build my website with integrating the food and recipe APIs. My website will be able to search for food that they want to cook and also can search for detail information for food such as calories and ingredient. If user want to upload their own recipe they are welcome to do so in my website. They can add their own favorite list from the searched list and they can also delete the food from the list. I will use some ember addon such as ember-moment and ember-burger-menu to style my website look efficiently.
